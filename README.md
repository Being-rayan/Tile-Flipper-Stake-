Diamond Grid Game

This is a simple command-line Python game where players try to uncover hidden diamonds 💎 on a grid without hitting an empty tile. The grid size and number of diamonds are decided by the user, making each round different. The goal is to build the longest streak by selecting the correct tiles.

The project focuses on core Python fundamentals such as 2D lists, random placement logic, input validation, loops, and exception handling. It demonstrates how basic programming concepts can be combined to create an interactive and dynamic game experience.
